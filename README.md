# Explainable-AI

Everything needed to replicate this project is contained within the accompanying Colab Notebook.

The only requirement is an isolated Google Shared Drive where the Colab Notebook can be opened.

Everything else can be done within the notebook.

From the project:

"In this project, I will train a deep convolutional neural network agent to classify chest X-rays, and apply the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method to exaplain how the algorithm is making its decisions.

Then, I will explore an alternative explainability method that unifies earlier explainability approaches and is supported by the game theory research of American Mathematician Lloyd Shapley (SHAP.)"


Enjoy!
